# Contributing

## Branching
- Create a branch per feature, e.g., `feature/ui`, `feature/form-validation`, `feature/filters-storage`.
- Keep commits small and meaningful.

## Commit messages
- Use conventional style:
  - `feat(ui): improve list spacing`
  - `fix(form): handle empty quantity`
  - `refactor: extract renderItem()`

## Pull Requests
- Link to the issue/task.
- Describe changes and screenshots (if UI).
- Request review from teammates.
